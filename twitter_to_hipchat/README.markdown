This example will check twitter for search keywords and post to a Hipchat chat room.

This can be scheduled to run every so often if you want to constantly update your room.

Hipchat setup is easy, just go to your admin section, click API tokens and make one.

Twitter search doesn't require authentication (thankfully because it's much more complicated to get a token).
